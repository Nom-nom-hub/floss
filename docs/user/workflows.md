# Workflows Guide

This guide explains how to use FLOSS for common development workflows.

## Session Management

FLOSS uses sessions to maintain context across interactions. Sessions are automatically saved and can be resumed later.

### Starting a New Session

To start a new session, simply run:

```bash
floss
```

### Resuming a Previous Session

To resume a previous session, use the `--session` flag:

```bash
floss --session=my-project
```

### Listing Sessions

To list all available sessions:

```bash
floss sessions list
```

### Deleting Sessions

To delete a session:

```bash
floss sessions delete my-project
```

## Code Review Workflow

FLOSS can help with code reviews by analyzing changes and providing feedback.

### Reviewing Changes

To review recent changes in your Git repository:

```bash
floss review
```

This will analyze the changes in your current branch compared to the base branch and provide feedback.

### Reviewing Specific Files

To review specific files:

```bash
floss review path/to/file.go path/to/other/file.py
```

### Generating Review Comments

FLOSS can generate review comments that can be posted to your code review platform:

```bash
floss review --format=comments
```

## Documentation Generation

FLOSS can help generate documentation for your code.

### Generating Documentation

To generate documentation for your project:

```bash
floss docs generate
```

This will analyze your code and generate documentation based on code comments and structure.

### Updating Documentation

To update existing documentation:

```bash
floss docs update
```

## Testing Assistance

FLOSS can help with writing and debugging tests.

### Generating Test Cases

To generate test cases for a file:

```bash
floss test generate path/to/file.go
```

### Debugging Test Failures

To help debug test failures:

```bash
floss test debug
```

This will analyze the test output and suggest potential fixes.

## Refactoring Assistance

FLOSS can help with code refactoring.

### Suggesting Refactorings

To get suggestions for code improvements:

```bash
floss refactor suggest
```

### Applying Refactorings

To apply suggested refactorings:

```bash
floss refactor apply
```

## Learning New Technologies

FLOSS can help you learn new technologies and frameworks.

### Technology Exploration

To explore a new technology:

```bash
floss learn "react hooks"
```

This will provide an overview of the topic and suggest resources for further learning.

### Code Examples

To generate code examples:

```bash
floss example "how to use context in React"
```

## Project Setup

FLOSS can help set up new projects.

### Initializing a New Project

To initialize a new project:

```bash
floss init
```

This will ask questions about your project and set up appropriate configuration.

### Adding Dependencies

To add dependencies to your project:

```bash
floss deps add lodash
```

### Configuring Tools

To configure development tools:

```bash
floss config setup
```

## Troubleshooting

FLOSS can help troubleshoot issues with your code or development environment.

### Diagnosing Issues

To diagnose an issue:

```bash
floss troubleshoot "my app is not starting"
```

### Checking Environment

To check your development environment:

```bash
floss env check
```

## Best Practices

### Context Management

- Provide relevant context files to help FLOSS understand your project
- Use `.flossignore` to exclude files that shouldn't be considered
- Regularly update your session to keep context fresh

### Provider Selection

- Choose providers based on the task at hand
- Use larger models for complex reasoning tasks
- Use smaller models for simple queries to save costs

### Session Organization

- Use descriptive session names
- Regularly clean up old sessions
- Use tags to organize related sessions

## Advanced Workflows

### Custom Workflows

You can create custom workflows by combining FLOSS commands with shell scripts.

### Integration with Development Tools

FLOSS can be integrated with your existing development tools through:

1. **Editor Integration**: Use FLOSS as a language server
2. **Git Hooks**: Run FLOSS commands automatically during Git operations
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Use FLOSS in your continuous integration pipelines

### Automation

FLOSS can be used to automate repetitive tasks:

```bash
floss run "generate unit tests for all functions in src/"
```

This command will generate unit tests for all functions in the src/ directory.

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Use Slash Commands**: FLOSS supports various slash commands for common tasks
2. **Context is Key**: Provide relevant files and information for better results
3. **Iterate**: Don't hesitate to ask follow-up questions for clarification
4. **Experiment**: Try different providers and models to see what works best for your use case
5. **Save Sessions**: Save important sessions for future reference
