## Key Principles:

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each agent has ONE primary focus and does NOT overlap with others

### 2. Clear Boundaries
Agents know exactly what they can and cannot do

### 3. Centralized Coordination
Only Orchestrator and File Organization System coordinate activities

### 4. Escalation Paths
Conflicts follow defined escalation routes

### 5. No Direct Peer Communication
Agents communicate ONLY through proper channels
